# Addressbook
Addressbook for my computer science course (Programm in German)

Programm, variables and methodnames are kept in English but constant strings and notifications as well as the whole GUI are in German.

This little programm is just a test for my computer science course. It's made to explain how Java works and uses some essential features of Java:

- OOP
- Serialization
- Class in class
- GUI

It's open source and under creative commons. So feel free to use it (personal & commercial purposes) and to edit and republish it.
